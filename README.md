# out_of_equilibrium_nonlinear_SSH
This code evaluates the time evolution of a set of differential equations correspoding to an
out of equilibrium Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. It includes saturable pumps on first and last sites,
and linear decays on all sites. It includes three different numerical solvers.
